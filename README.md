# 🌌 3D Solar System – Interactive Web App

This project is a **fully interactive 3D simulation of the Solar System** built using **Three.js** and **vanilla JavaScript**. It visualizes the Sun and all 8 planets orbiting in real-time, with smooth animations, responsive design, and bonus features like tooltips, dark/light mode, and zoom interactions.

## 🚀 Features

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🌞 Sun & 8 Planets | All planets from Mercury to Neptune orbit around the Sun. |
| ⚙️ Real-time Speed Control | Sliders for adjusting each planet's orbital speed dynamically. |
| 🕹 Pause / Resume | Toggle planetary motion on/off. |
| 🌠 Background Stars | Adds visual depth with 1000+ 3D stars. |
| 🏷 Planet Tooltips | Hovering on a planet shows its name. |
| 🌗 Dark / Light Mode | Switch between visual themes seamlessly. |
| 🔍 Zoom on Click | Click a planet to smoothly zoom in on it. |
| 📱 Fully Responsive | Works great on all screen sizes and modern browsers. |

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) – 3D graphics engine for rendering the solar system
- HTML5 + CSS3 – Semantic layout and responsive design
- Vanilla JavaScript – Orbit animations, DOM manipulation, raycasting
- WebGL – GPU-accelerated rendering (via Three.js)

## 📊 Learning Objectives

Through this project, I learned:

- How to build interactive 3D scenes with Three.js
- Creating orbits, lighting, and camera perspectives
- Using `raycaster` for interactivity (tooltips, zoom)
- UI/UX design with responsive sliders and buttons
- Smooth animation using `requestAnimationFrame`
